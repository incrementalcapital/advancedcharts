/* 
 * index.css - Styles for the React application, using Tailwind CSS directives and custom rules.
 * 
 * Include Tailwind's base styles, providing a foundation for common HTML elements and resetting default browser styles.
 * Include Tailwind's component styles, offering pre-designed UI elements like buttons, forms, and navigation. 
 * Include Tailwind's utility classes, enabling on-the-fly styling with a vast library of CSS classes. 
 *
 * Target the html, body, and the element with id "root" (typically the main container for a React app):
 * - Set their height to 100% of the viewport, ensuring they occupy the entire available space.
 * - Remove default margins and padding to prevent unwanted spacing around these elements.
